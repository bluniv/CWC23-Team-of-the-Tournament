Overview
This project is a data-driven analysis to determine the Team of the Tournament for the Cricket World Cup 2023 (CWC23) held in India. The goal was to form a balanced team with specific player roles, including 5 batsmen, 1 allrounder, 5 bowlers, and a wicketkeeping batsman among the top 5 batsmen.

Data Collection
For this project, detailed statistics and performance data for all players in the Cricket World Cup 2023 were collected from ESPN website. There are 4 datasets :- batting, bowling, keeping and teams performance. The data included key metrics such as runs scored, batting average, strike rate, wickets taken, and economy rate.

Data Preprocessing
The data underwent a thorough cleaning and preprocessing phase to handle missing values, ensure consistency in player names, and format the datasets for analysis.

Player Classification
Players were categorized into different roles based on their primary skills: batsmen, allrounders, and bowlers.

Ranking and Selection Criteria
Defined criteria were established for ranking players within each category. Factors considered included runs scored, batting average, strike rate for batsmen; runs scored, wickets taken, economy rate for allrounders; and wickets taken, economy rate, strike rate for bowlers.
Points system was used to determine the batsmen and bowlers.
1) Batting Points = Runs + (Strike Rate)*2 + (Average)*0.5
2) Bowling Points = (Wickets)*3 - (Average)*0.2 - (Economy)*0.2 - (Strike Rate)*0.2

Team Formation
The selection criteria were applied to identify the top 5 batsmen, 1 allrounder, and 5 bowlers based on their performances in the tournament.

Wicketkeeping Batsman
Special attention was given to ensuring that the selected wicketkeeper was among the top 5 batsmen.

Team of the Tournament
The final "Team of the Tournament" was formed by combining the selected players from each category, meeting the specified requirements for team composition.

Visualization
Optionally, visualizations such as lineup graphics or performance comparison charts were created to represent the selected team and their statistics.

Documentation and Reporting
A comprehensive documentation of the methodology, criteria, and the final selected team was provided. Insights into why certain players were chosen based on their performances were included.

Validation
The team selection was validated by comparing it with official awards or recognition given during or after the tournament.
