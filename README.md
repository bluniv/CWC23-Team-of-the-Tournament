**1. Overview**  
This project is a data-driven analysis to determine the Team of the Tournament for the Cricket World Cup 2023 (CWC23) held in India. The goal was to form a balanced team with specific player roles, including 5 batsmen, 1 allrounder, 5 bowlers, and a wicketkeeping batsman among the top 5 batsmen.

For this project, detailed statistics and performance data for all players in the Cricket World Cup 2023 were collected from ESPN website. There are 4 datasets :- batting, bowling, keeping and teams performance. The data included key metrics such as runs scored, batting average, strike rate, wickets taken, and economy rate.  

**3. Data Preprocessing**  
The data underwent a thorough cleaning and preprocessing phase to handle missing values, ensure consistency in player names, and format the datasets for analysis.
